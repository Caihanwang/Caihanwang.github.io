## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

In this blog, I trained a deep learning model to classify beetles, cockroaches and dragonflies using these [images](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fn73sj2e6c9rhf6/insects.zip?dl=0). You can also download the origin images from the [link](https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/insects.zip). After model training, I evaluated the model by the accuracy and explained the model by [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap).
